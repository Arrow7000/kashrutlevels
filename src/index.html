    <section>
      <p>
        Have you ever wondered if you could eat at a friend’s house? Or whether
        that date you just asked out eats at only strictly kosher restaurants?
        Maybe you’re unsure if you should eat at the work party you have just
        been invited to?
      </p>
      <p>Well then, this website is here to help you.</p>
      <p>
        Despite there not being many of us, there is an enormous spectrum of
        what us jews will and won’t eat or drink. For people across the jewish
        diaspora, keeping to the absolute strictest levels of kashrut can be in
        the eyes of many, particularly restrictive and difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is fair to say that regardless of the rules of jewish law, it is
        within human nature to pick and choose what aspects of our religion we
        decide to keep.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what I have created is a simple, extensive, but non exhaustive
        kashrut level system. The product of a shabbat conversation with friends
        a few years ago, this sets out the basic parameters within which the
        majority of jewish people would find themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note, this list cannot and does not include every discrepancy,
        choice and allowance that every single person may find themselves
        observing, however I hope that for most people this can provide a rough
        guide to the multitude of kashrut variations that people observe.
